    <h2>Monday</h2>
    <p>
      So this week we are having one to one with our tutors, so we they can get
      a greater understand of me, and what my goals are. What I am hoping to
      gain from this course. But my one to one was not today. We started the day
      by having a quick lecture about Flexbox. The lecture went over what
      exactly Flexbox is, and how best to use it. Also how to get the best out
      of it, as well as going over a few examples to make sure that we
      understand how to implement it, and how to get the best of it. After that
      we were then asked to continue working on our websites for the rest of the
      day. As other people’s one to one were being conducted throughout the day.

    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <p>
      So for today we started learning about project management, for this we
      were given some self-study slides to go over in groups of about 3 to 4. So
      the slides would go over some of the basics of project management and we
      would be able to discuss the slides with other people in our groups. These
      slides gave us a good insight into the different stages of project
      management. As we continued through the slides together, we reached the
      first task. Which required us to think about creating a data schema for an
      archery app, not to write it out in SQL, but to just think about: How many
      Tables? What fields in each Table? What data types? Once that was
      completed and we had a good understand of what we might need for our
      archery app. We were then asked to design an interface for our app, using
      any tool we like.

    <h2>Wednesday</h2>
    <p>
      So for most of the week we have been doing a few lecture, but mostly we
      had been focusing on completing and adding the final touches to our
      websites. So for the whole day we were working on our websites, whilst the
      tutors were doing one to ones with every student. Today was the day that I
      had my first 1 to 1 with a tutor, so to begin with he asked me some
      questions. These mainly focused on the work that we had been doing during
      the course. The purpose of these one to one, is to make sure that I am
      understand all the topics we are going over. As well as giving me the
      opportunity to ask any questions, and discuss any problems that I am
      having at the moment. To be honest at the time of my one to one, I wasn’t
      really having any problems. I put that down to the fact that we are only
      at the beginning stages of the course and most of the topics have been
      fairly straight-forward. However I am convince in the future that this
      will change as the topics get more complex, and that task we need to do
      more difficult. We also discussed any goals that I had, I told him that I
      wanted to become a competent programmer. So we discussed some possible
      targets for me, one of which being that I should try and complete more
      code wars challenges. To try and increase my level on that, we discussed
      trying to get to the honour score of 30, which I surpassed a few days ago.
      I think I am currently at an honour score of 50, so that is a big
      improvement.
