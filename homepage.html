      <p>
        Hello, I'm Andrew, but you can call me Andy. I'm currently on the path
        to becoming a computer programmer, driven by my passion for technology
        and problem-solving. Beyond coding, I'm a sports enthusiast with a deep
        love for football and the NFL. Golf, pool, and snooker are my go-to
        hobbies for unwinding, and I'm also an avid gamer, exploring virtual
        worlds whenever I can. My current goal is to realize my dream of
        becoming a software developer. Recently, I embarked on a new adventure,
        temporarily relocating to broaden my skill set and explore diverse
        career opportunities. This experience has made me a more flexible,
        self-motivated, and hard-working individual. My diverse work background
        includes roles in customer service, communication, amusement ride
        operation, and bicycle maintenance, where I honed a range of specific
        and transferable skills. One of the highlights of my journey has been
        the joy of collaborating with colleagues and building positive working
        relationships. Now, equipped with these valuable skills, I'm back in the
        Fylde area, eager to embark on the next phase of my career. Let's
        connect and explore how we can work together to make the most of the
        exciting road ahead.
