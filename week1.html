    <h2>Monday</h2>
    <p>
      In the Morning; we started to go over some more JavaScript Fundamental.
      This lecture in particular was about Objects. So we need to explore the
      concept of an object. How to access data from within an object. After the
      lecture we need to complete 3 tasks. The first two I had no problem with.
      But with the third task we needed to create a coffee shop program that
      would help to calculate the cost. I struggled for a while with this one
      because it simple would not function the way I intended it to. After a
      while I came to realise after looking over my code that I had missed a =
      sign out of my code. Which was causing it to not function properly. In the
      Afternoon; we started to talk about HTML. Which is really the first time I
      had really ever looked at HTML before, so I found the lecture to be very
      interesting. So beginning to look into how websites are created was very
      interesting. So I had no real problems with the task throughout this
      lecture. Only problems I seem to really have is that I keep forgetting key
      bits of syntax throughout my code, which means that it sometimes doesn’t
      work correctly. So that is something that I’ll need to work on over the
      length of the course.

    <h2>Tuesday</h2>
    <p>
      We started to learn about database, getting to know the general attributes
      of a flat file database as well as being able to describe what the use
      might be for a database. Then learning what a primary key is in a
      database, and that it enables you to give a uniquely identity to each row.
      Keys are used to establish relationships between tables. Then we started
      to go through SQL. Trying to find out exactly what it is and why it has
      been in use for such a long time. It was really my first time using SQL so
      I found it challenging to begin with but after a few attempts I was able
      to get a handle of the basics. Afterwards we went back to some more HTML;
      this time learning how to add images to our websites. I struggled for a
      while to complete this task, because for some reason it just would not
      load up the image. But after getting frustrated I managed to see that I
      had just misspelled the word and that is the reason it couldn’t find the
      image.

    <h2>Wednesday</h2>
    <p>
      So we began the day by completing a Code Wars task first, we were only
      supposed to do one. But I was given a few easy task, so was able to
      complete a few before we started the next lecture. This lecture about CSS,
      basically telling us that CSS is one of the ways that we can give our
      website a personally touch and make them look more professional. After the
      lecture we were split into teams of 2 and ask to create a PowerPoint about
      a Position in CSS. Then once completed to present out finding to the rest
      of the group, and making sure we spoke for around 5 to 10 minutes. I won’t
      lie, I really don’t like talking in public or even on teams. But I know
      that I will have to do something like this on the future. But in the end
      despite my own nerves and my colleagues, I think the PowerPoint will be
      good. Towards the end we need to set up a GitHub repository for our
      websites, so that the tutors can look at our websites and how they are
      progressing.

    <h2>Thursday</h2>
    <p>
      So today we continued to talk about databases as well continuing to talk
      about SQL. We stated to talk about SQL statements and there uses, and we
      need to learn about different SQL statements. As well as learning about
      some SQL such as; SELECT, WHERE, Comparison, Operators and others. We need
      to demonstrate that we understood the different operators and also that we
      knew how to use them. We were introduced to SQL Fiddle, which is a website
      you can use to test your own SQL code. So for the rest of the day we used
      SQL Fiddle to complete as set of task that had been set for us at the end
      of the lecture. Overall I didn’t really have a problem with any of the
      tasks and was able to complete before the end of the day.
    </p>

    <h2>Friday</h2>
    <p>
      So in the morning we had to present our presentation to the rest of the
      group as well as watching and learning from everyone else’s presentations.
      So for the most part I was really happy with our presentation. I felt like
      we were able to get our point across about position. Once all the
      presentations were completed and everyone had been given the chance to
      show their PowerPoints. We were able to spend the rest of the day on our
      website to experiment and to add new things and polished what we had
      already done. Later on in the day we had an employability session. Where
      we talked about what kind of traits and experience employers may be
      looking for.
